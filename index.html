<p id="firsttest">They catered for my wedding, and the food was absolutely phenomenal! My entire family are carnivores, so we sadly cannot
eat vegetables, or anything outside of animal products. The chefs at Black Goose Bistro were understanding of our special diet, though,
and even made us a butter, eggs, and liver cake for us to cut and share with everyone!<br>If you're also a carnivore, or just 
need an excellent catering service, I will never stop recommending Black Goose Bistro!</p>

<p>Why are the kid's menu prices so outrageously expensive? I came here with my family of 8, and while the food was good, we're now in debt from having to feed our 7 children, too. I would recommend this to anyone who DOESN'T have children. If you do, take the family to McDonald's or something that won't put you in debt.</p>

<p>The grilled cheeses are so inexpensive because they use rubber instead of actual cheese. Don't believe me? I went undercover as a cook at the Black Goose Bistro to find out what REALLY goes on in Massachusetts' favorite restaruant. The documentary releases 4/1/2010 at 7:00PM EST on my youtuber channel, Cahaya Abramsen UNDERCOVER.</p>

<p class = "review">When I searched up the Black Goose Bistro, I was met with a mixed bag of reviews, to say the least. I needed a caterer to provide fresh, quality food to my triplets' quincea√±era. I was unsure of their providence, but after I entered the Bistro for a taste test, a world of mouth-watering smells and spices greeted me. I knew that even with the exorbitant prices for their quesadillas, nobody else would be able to come as close to authentic Mexican food than the Black Goose Bistro. And my daughters loved it! I have their email saved in my contacts for when my mother-in-law kicks the bucket. If you need overpriced food, then look no further than the Black Goose. I promise it's not a goose chase.
